Build a simple blockchain in Go [![Buy me a tree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20me%20a%20tree-%F0%9F%8C%B3-lightgreen)](https://offset.earth/adrian) 
===============================

Let's mix **two buzzwords together**, and voilÃ !

This project was mainly **inspired by articles** I read on the internet like "*make your blockchain with INSERT-AWESOME-LANGUAGE-HERE*".

I had some time to kill, I'm a **crypto enthusiast**, so I put some love into making a dead simple blockchain in Go. Let's see it as another way of digging a bit deeper in Golang as a newcomer.

I don't know what else to say so... have a great life, and **be proud of who you are** !
